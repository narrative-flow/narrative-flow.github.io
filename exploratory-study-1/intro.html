<p>
The purpose of this study is to better understand if and how data-driven stories can be compelling to readers.
</p>

<p>
We ask you to experience a data-driven story in different settings:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>

        with or without animated transitions,
        <img src="img/setting-1.png" alt="animation or no animation via toggle switches" />
    </li>
    <li>

        and using arrow buttons or scrolling to advance the narrative.
        <img src="img/setting-2.png" alt="scrolling or arrow buttons via toggle switches" />
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
We would like you to experiment reading the story with these different settings and report their impact on your reading experience via a short questionnaire.  Web-based interactions with the story will be logged and submitted along with the questionnaire.
</p>

<p>
Please:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        read the story in different settings and complete the questionnaire <em>right afterwards</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        do <b>not</b> reload the page
    </li>
    <li>
        do <b>not</b> retake the study after you have submitted all your responses
    </li>
</ol>
