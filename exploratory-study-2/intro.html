 The purpose of this study is to better understand how different navigational paradigms affect the consumption of data-driven visual stories and the overall story experience.
</p>

<p>
We will ask you to experience a visual story in two different settings: as a <i>stepper</i> and a <i>scroller</i>.
</p>

<p>
You will be asked to read a story in these conditions and provide your feedback after each chapter. We are utilizing a real-world story about machine learning created by Stephanie Yee & Tony Chu, broken up into three chapters. We will ask you to read this story as you normally would and provide your honest feedback on the different navigation paradigms.
